                  The usage of software and communication technologies in the field of Transport has made enormous contributions to the developments in the sector. It has also resulted in progressive economic competency and development. Automatic data collection systems including automatic vehicle location systems, automatic passenger counting systems, advanced passenger information systems and electronic fare payment and ticketing systems are ruling the roost in the field of transport and communications. This has led to an ubiquitous impact on the quality and availability of information for service and operations planning, controlling, and measuring of the resultant service quality that is delivered to passengers. The role and importance of Information Technology has only intensified across various sectors of the economy.

                            Information Technology can be assimilated in educational and teaching methodologies to heighten interest levels among students, while also providing a platform for innovation and advancement in the process of teaching and learning. According to a recent research publication coming from the University of California, ‘Websites which are designed exclusively for the purpose of making learning fun, will not only increase the hours of study, but also impact memory and information retention positively.’ Thus, the inclusion of the software industry in the service sectors will definitely prove to be beneficial in the long run.

                         The Business Dictionary defines Marketing as, ‘The management process through which goods and services move from concept to the customer; Marketing is based on thinking about the business in terms of customer needs and their satisfaction.’ In today’s technology obsessed world, what better way to attract and persuade consumers, but with the use of websites? Extremely popular websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay, Myntra and Snapdeal have managed to hook customers to their desktops. Hardly anyone goes to the physical retail outlets or stores anymore. Shopping for all kinds of commodities and goods happen extensively on web portals in recent years, according to statistical data that has been collected, surveying the popularity of online shopping techniques. However, the advent of site based shopping has definitely deterred the growth of retail stores.

                              A society is an amalgamation of various factors. It includes humans, nature, capital, and systems. It also involves the harmonious integration and combination of these factors, for a rich and purposeful existence at a wholesome sense. None of this would be possible without Information Technology. If not for Information Technology, how would we send important messages across the globe in a matter of few seconds? How would we contact family that lives miles across? How would we communicate at all, when there comes up, the problem of distance? There is no answer, because the situation in itself is unthinkable. Thus, the direct as well as indirect role, and importance of the IT industry in the social sector is surely quite self explanatory.
