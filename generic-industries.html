                      A Smartphone today comes with the space and utility for a million apps. Ranging from in built apps like Contacts, a basic email facility app and a basal messaging app, to the highly installed social media apps like WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, our phones are nothing short of what can be called ‘Smart’.  These phones are transformed into ‘Smart ‘-phones by software engineers and developers from all across the world. Software engineers design, construct, and develop some rudimentary algorithmic computer programmes into the rather complex applications, which none of us can do without in today’s intense technology driven, and technology dependent lifestyle. If not for the engineers and the entire Information Technology industry as such, we would have literally no applications to avail of.

                               Web Apps or Website apps, are basically applications designed and developed for easing out browsing techniques for a user. For instance, if a user is browsing for downloading music, he can key in the name of the song that he requires. Now this key in, will bring about a number of website links from which the user can find his various requirements. Thus, websites are created with the intention of making the internet immensely accessible and user friendly. Websites, like other software applications are thought of, designed and constructed by the IT industry, using codes and programmes of various kinds.

                                    Cloud computing or cloud infrastructure, is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet. Cloud computing enables companies to consume any computer resource, such as a virtual machine (VM), storage facility, or an application as a utility (like electricity) rather than having to build and maintain computing infrastructures of their own.  Advocates of Cloud computing claim that it enables many companies to avoid up-front infrastructural costs (like the purchase of servers). It also enables organizations to focus on their core business activities, instead of spending extensive resources on building computer infrastructure. Research suggests that cloud computing also allows enterprises to fasten up their application run rate, improve manageability skills and reduce maintenance costs; Thus aiding Information Technology  teams in the optimum utilization of resources and adept management of dynamic business demands.

                       Data analytics (DA) is the process of examination of data sets, in order to draw inferences about the information that they contain, with the help of specialized software systems.  It entails the inspecting, cleansing, transforming, modelling, and comprehending of data for the purpose of achieving specific goals. For instance, a researcher in the field of Biotechnology will store genetic information in the form of structured data in a database, post the process of Data Analytics. DA, is again, is done using algorithmic coding and statistical computational approaches. It is a programming system that is extensively used in many fields of scientific research, a boon from the Software industry.

                         	Big data refers to large data sets that are analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, or associations. Big data contains both structured and unstructured data that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. However, it’s not the amount of data that’s important, but what organizations do with this data. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves. Adept and technically sound analysis of big data can help companies in the determination of the root causes of failures, the generation of coupons based on customer preferences, recalculation of risk portfolios and detection of fraudulent behaviour before it affects the Organization. Thus, software programming helps in innumerable manners.

                     One of the most intriguing developments in the field of science and technology is indeed Artificial Intelligence. It blends the programming of systems with human tendencies and behavioural methods, to result in the fabrication of machines with superior human intelligence. Science fiction has popularized AI in the form of robots and talking machines. However, AI constitutes everything from SIRI to Google’s Search Algorithms. There are two types of AI – Narrow or Weak AI, and General or Strong AI. While Weak AI would constitute machines that have expertise in specific tasks, General AI entails machines that are excellent in performing all human tasks beyond a state of perfection. Extensive research is undertaken abroad in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, thus using coding to explore maximal standards of human creativity.
